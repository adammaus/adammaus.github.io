Closeness Centrality

* Nodes with short geodesic (shortest path between two nodes) distances to other nodes tend to have higher closeness
* A vertex's closeness is defined as the inverse of the mean geodesic distance from vertex _v_ to any other vertex in the graph
* Given the definition of Closeness, a large number of algorithms exist to compute it efficiently.
* Varying algorithms also rank closeness so no single algorithm works best.
