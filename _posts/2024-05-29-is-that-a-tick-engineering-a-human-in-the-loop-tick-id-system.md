Samuel Nowak and I gave a talk about building a deep learning powered pipeline to identify Ticks in [The Tick App](https://tickapp.us/) at the University of Wisconsin – Madison's [IT Professionals Conference](https://itproconf.wisc.edu/2024/05/29/is-that-a-tick-engineering-a-human-in-the-loop-tick-id-system/) in May 2024. Check out the video below!

If you spend time in wooded areas, you probably know how important it is to check for ticks afterward. Join us to learn about the Tick App, a citizen science project developed by researchers at UW–Madison with collaborators across the U.S. In this informative talk, we'll show how the Tick App enables users to submit pictures of ticks they've found and how researchers identify what kind they are. We'll discuss the evolution of this identification system and how we've started integrating AI into it.

Attendees will:

* Discover how the Tick App enables users to submit pictures of ticks they've found and contribute to valuable research
* Learn about the semi-automated, human-in-the-loop identification process used by researchers to classify tick species
* Gain insights into the evolution of the Tick App's overall system and the lessons learned during its development
