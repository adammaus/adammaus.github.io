_Open to opportunities. Please reach out [here](/contact/)._

I'm a software developer at the University of Wisconsin – Madison.
* Currently, I work full-time with the [School of Medicine and Public Health](https://iit.med.wisc.edu/) (SMPH).
* I also consult for the [Midwest Center of Excellence for Vector-Borne Disease](https://mcevbd.wisc.edu/) (MCEVBD) and [Center for Health Enhancement Systems Studies](https://center.chess.wisc.edu/) (CHESS).
* Prior to switching to SMPH in early 2025, I worked at CHESS for **18 years** in various roles and, in late 2024 - mid-2025, I had a part-time stint at the [Wisconsin Geologic and Natural History Survey](https://home.wgnhs.wisc.edu/) (WGNHS) as their Interim Web Developer while also working at SMPH and CHESS.

Throughout my career, I have always had a passion for helping others through my work. Whether that be helping researchers maintain data for their vein imaging studies going back more than a decade at SMPH, deploying code to share over a 150 years worth of Wisconsin geological research at WGNHS, developing systems for more than 7,000 patients undergoing health crises at CHESS, or building a citizen science app called [The Tick App](https://tickapp.us/) for MCEVBD to track over 15,000 tick reports.

My current interests include:
* applications of machine learning in citizen science, for example, the use of a [convolution neural network model to identify ticks](/2024/05/is-that-a-tick-engineering-a-human-in-the-loop-tick-id-system/)
* wildlife and environmental conservation (especially through software development)
* modernizing and refactoring legacy systems
* building systems to help researchers and their studies
* designing user and developer experiences that bring joy

As a undergraduate and graduate student, I published two papers about the applications of neural networks in Chaos Theory with my advisor Professor Julien Clinton Sprott.

Outside of my day job, I'm the secretary, website maintainer and, at times, volunteer coordinator for the [Friends of Military Ridge State Trail](https://www.friendsofmilitaryridgetrail.org/) in Wisconsin. I became a certified [Wisconsin Master Naturalist](https://wimasternaturalist.org/) in 2025 and volunteer my time doing environmental citizen science, stewardship, and education. I can't recommend that program enough for those who love nature and learning new things every day.

A few other nuggets:

* I enjoy endurance sports like long distance running and triathlons, reading (usually sci-fi but dabble in other genres), cooking, gardening with native plants, wandering around the woods, [Chickadees (Genus Poecile)](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/144351-Poecile), and writing.
* [Eric Maus](https://www.ericmaus.com/), my brother, and I were finalists at 2020 Austin Film Festival for a full-length holiday romantic screenplay named "Holiday on the Hills." We've also written the treatment for another holiday romantic screenplay called "Mars by Christmas." We haven't found someone to produce either yet, so let us know if you're interested. By the way, if you're looking for a book to read, you should check out his debut novel, [Women & Whiskey](https://www.ericmaus.com/women-and-whiskey).

I avoid the socials but you can find me online at:
