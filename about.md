_Open to opportunities. Please reach out [here](../contact/)._

I'm a Software Developer with the [School of Medicine and Public Health](https://iit.med.wisc.edu/) (SMPH) at the University of Wisconsin – Madison. Before starting in early 2025, I worked in various developer roles at the [Center for Health Enhancement Systems Studies](https://center.chess.wisc.edu/) (CHESS) at the University of Wisconsin – Madison for 18 years. I've also had stints at the [Wisconsin Geologic and Natural History Survey](https://home.wgnhs.wisc.edu/) (WGNHS) as the Interim Web Developer and [Midwest Center of Excellence for Vector Borne Disease](https://mcevbd.wisc.edu/) as a consultant.

Throughout my career, I have always had a passion for helping people through my work. Whether that be helping researchers doing studies on vein imaging at SMPH, deploying code to share Wisconsin geology research, or helping patients undergoing health crises at CHESS.

My current interests include:
* applications of machine learning in citizen science, for example, the use of a [convolution neural network model to identify ticks](/2024/05/is-that-a-tick-engineering-a-human-in-the-loop-tick-id-system/) in [The Tick App](https://tickapp.us/)
* wildlife and environmental conservation (especially through the use of software development)
* modernizing and refactoring legacy systems
* building systems to help researchers and their studies
* user and developer experience design

Previously, I worked on the use of neural networks in Chaos Theory.

Outside of my day job, I'm the secretary of the [Friends of Military Ridge State Trail](https://www.friendsofmilitaryridgetrail.org/) in Wisconsin and help with trail maintenance and improvement. I'm also a certified [Wisconsin Master Naturalist](https://wimasternaturalist.org/) and volunteer my time doing environmental citizen science, stewardship, and education. I can't recommend that program enough for those interested in natural history.

A few other nuggets:

* I enjoy endurance sports like long distance running and triathlons, reading sci-fi, cooking, gardening with native plants, wandering around the woods, [Chickadees (Genus Poecile)](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/144351-Poecile), and writing.
* [Eric Maus](https://www.ericmaus.com/), my brother, and I were finalists at 2020 Austin Film Festival for a full-length holiday romantic screenplay named “Holiday on the Hills” We've also written the treatment for another holiday romantic screenplay called “Mars by Christmas.” We haven't found someone to produce either yet, so let us know if you're interested. If you're looking for a book to read, you should check out his debut novel, [Women & Whiskey](https://www.ericmaus.com/women-and-whiskey).

I avoid the socials but you can find me online at:
